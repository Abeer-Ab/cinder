Important Notes Regarding Closed Branches
=========================================

This README applies to release notes for branches that are closed. This
includes End of Life branches that had used reno for release notes management.
The list of series, and their stable status, can be found here:

https://releases.openstack.org/

To save a significant
amount of time in gate jobs that build release notes, EOL branch release
notes are made static. Said another way, reno is no longer used to dynamically
generate the release notes for that branch as they are not expected to change
anymore.
