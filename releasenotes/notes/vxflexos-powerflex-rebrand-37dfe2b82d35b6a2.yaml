    Dell EMC VxFlex OS has been rebranded to PowerFlex. The driver
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.vxflexos.driver.VxFlexOSDriver``
    has been renamed to
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.powerflex.driver.PowerFlexDriver``.
    Although in this release the volume manager will recognize the old
    driver name, that functionality will be removed in the Wallaby
    release, and thus we recommend that you update the driver name in
    ``cinder.conf`` at your earliest convenience.

    Existing vxFlex OS configuration options will continue to work in this
    release, but this functionality will be removed in the Wallaby release.
    Thus all driver configuration options that start with ``vxflexos``
    should be updated to ``powerflex`` in your ``cinder.conf`` as soon
    as possible.

    Before the Rocky release, this driver was named
    ``cinder.volume.drivers.dell_emc.scaleio.driver.ScaleIODriver``.
    That name was deprecated in the Rocky release.  In this release,
    the pre-Rocky name for this driver is no longer recognized and
    support for configuration options beginning with ``sio`` has been
    removed.

    The online documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.
